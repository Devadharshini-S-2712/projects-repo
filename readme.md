To predict the **median value of owner-occupied homes** using various features of the house and its location. The goal is to create a regression model that learns the relationship between input variables and house prices.



Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (for ML)
- matplotlib (for visualization)


Machine Learning Model

- **Model Used**: Linear Regression  
- **Input Features**: All columns except the target variable (`MEDV`)  
- **Target Variable**: `MEDV` — Median house value in $1000s

#Steps Performed in Code

1. **Importing Required Libraries**
2. **Loading the Dataset (`boston.csv`)**
3. **Inspecting the Dataset**
4. **Separating Features (X) and Target (y)**
5. **Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets**
6. **Training the Linear Regression Model**
7. **Making Predictions**
8. **Evaluating the Model (MSE, R² Score)**
9. **Visualizing Results (Actual vs Predicted Prices)**
